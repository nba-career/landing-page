# NBA Career Longevity Predictor

Are you tired of guessing which players are going to make a lasting impact in the NBA? Guess no more! This application will allow you to search current players and give you data that will give you insight into whether or not you should invest in this player for the long haul.

This site serves as a marketing page for the main React application that will feature various players and attempt to predict the longevity of that player using existing data sets.

I created a home page that describes the project to potential users and provides a way for users to login into the React application if they are interested in learning more about this project.

I designed both the home page and about page for this site and I also chose the font stack, colors and images for the site. The site is mobile responsive and also includes breakpoints for tablet sites as well. The LESS preprocessor is also used to style the site and manage variables for colors and media queries. 

On the about page, I created a modal component using JavaScript to display the biographies of each team member.
